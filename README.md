# intro-to-bun
These are the samples that I created when reading about Bun.

# install bun
``curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash``

# commands
Open the directory in the terminal, and run each file independently like below - 

1. ``bun password.ts``
2. ``bun fileio.ts ``
3. ``bun server.ts ``

For test case file, run ``bun test bun-test.ts``
